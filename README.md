## Signature Experiences

This build showcases MachineMind's blue ocean approach to wellness platforms:

### 1. Breathing Animation
The entire page subtly "breathes" — expanding and contracting like a meditation breath. Creates an unconscious sense of calm.

### 2. Aurora Glow
A soft, ethereal glow follows the cursor on desktop, creating a magical, meditative atmosphere.

### 3. Chakra Journey Navigation
Seven energy center points on the right side that navigate to different sections. Each chakra glows in its traditional color.

### 4. Moon Phase Widget
Real-time lunar phase display with spiritual guidance for each phase. Perfect for ceremony scheduling.

### 5. Sound Wave Visualizer
Animated waveform in the digital content section representing healing frequencies.

### 6. Console Easter Eggs
Open Developer Tools and type:
- `TU.explore()` — Secret menu
- `TU.breathe()` — Guided breathing exercise
- `TU.intention()` — Daily intention
- `TU.gratitude()` — Gratitude prompt
- `TU.mantra()` — Receive a mantra
- `TU.chakra()` — Chakra reading

### 7. Konami Code
